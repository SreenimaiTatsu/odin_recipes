    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying.</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch.</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt.</li>
        <li>1 cup water.</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk.</li>
        <li>2 large egg whites, lightly beaten.</li>
        <li>1 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined, tails left on.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, cornstarch, and salt together in a large bowl; make a well in the center.</li>
        <li>Pour water and egg yolk into the well and mix just until moistened; batter will be lumpy. Stir in egg whites.</li>
        <li>Dip one shrimp at a time into batter to coat; do not batter tails.</li>
        <li>When three shrimp have been battered, carefully place them into the deep fryer and fry until golden brown, about 1 1/2 minutes. </li>
        <li>Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining shrimp, battering a few at a time while the
         previous batch is cooking.</li>
    </ol>
